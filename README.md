# Nautobot DNS Models — Bitemporal Fork

> **This is a fork** of [`nautobot/nautobot-app-dns-models`](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-app-dns-models)
> distributed as **`nautobot-dns-models-bitemporal`** on PyPI.
>
> The fork adds bitemporal records (`valid_during` / `recorded_during` / `entry_id`
> on `DNSZone`, `DNSRegistration`, and every DNS record type) and an explicit
> `obj.amend()` API for sequenced amends. PostgreSQL-only; MySQL deployments
> behave identically to upstream.
>
> See [`docs/user/feature_bitemporal.md`](docs/user/feature_bitemporal.md) for
> the model + query API. The import path is unchanged (`import nautobot_dns_models`),
> so existing Python code targeting upstream works unchanged — only the
> `pyproject.toml` dependency name changes from `nautobot-dns-models` to
> `nautobot-dns-models-bitemporal`.
>
> **Breaking API change vs upstream 2.1.x**: `obj.save()` is in-place
> (matching framework expectations); use `obj.amend(field=value)` for the
> sequenced amend that rotates the belief log.

## Overview

The DNS models app adds specific DNS related models for managing DNS zones and records to Nautobot. The goal is to be able to manage a DNS configuration for a zone or sub-zone. These models can then be leveraged with 3rd party IPAM or DNS services in line with the rest of your network data.

### Screenshots

More screenshots can be found in the [Using the App](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/dns-models/en/latest/user/app_use_cases/) page in the documentation. Here's a quick overview of some of the app's added functionality:
